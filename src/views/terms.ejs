            <p class="">Agreement to terms</p>
            <p class="mb-8 font-light">
              These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement made
              between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you”)
              and 2nd Innings Technology Pvt Ltd ("Company", “we”, “us”, or
              “our”), concerning your access to and use of the rampUp.in website
              as well as any other media form, media channel, mobile website or
              mobile application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto
              (collectively, the “Site”). You agree that by accessing the Site,
              you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these
              Terms of Use. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS OF USE,
              THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SITE AND YOU MUST
              DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.
              <br />
              Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted
              on the Site from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated
              herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion,
              to make changes or modifications to these Terms of Use at any time
              and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by
              updating the “Last updated” date of these Terms of Use, and you
              waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It
              is your responsibility to periodically review these Terms of Use
              to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be
              deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the
              changes in any revised Terms of Use by your continued use of the
              Site after the date such revised Terms of Use are posted. The
              information provided on the Site is not intended for distribution
              to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country
              where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
              regulation or which would subject us to any registration
              requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly,
              those persons who choose to access the Site from other locations
              do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for
              compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are
              applicable.
              <br />
              The Site is not tailored to comply with industry-specific
              regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
              (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA),
              etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws,
              you may not use this Site. You may not use the Site in a way that
              would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). The Site is
              intended for users who are at least 13 years of age. All users who
              are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside (generally
              under the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be directly
              supervised by, their parent or guardian to use the Site. If you
              are a minor, you must have your parent or guardian read and agree
              to these Terms of Use prior to you using the Site.
